# Introduction

Divine sage Narada arrives at the hermitage of Sage Valmiki in order to enlighten him and keep him informed of his duty
to author the epic poem Ramayana. In the dialogue between these two sages, Valmiki elicits from Narada about most
virtuous person on earth, namely Rama. In this opening chapter, while eulogizing Rama Narada gives an outline of
Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes in this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality,
chastity and the like. Valmiki Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of
Gayatri Hymn, and a thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of each letter. Though that
classification, or dividing verses into thousand chapters is unavailable now, the twenty-four verses identified with the
24 letters of Gayatri hymn, called as Gayatri Ramayana, is available and it is given in the endnote of this page. In
tune with the scheme of Gayatri, Ramayana starts the first verse with letter ta an auspicious letter.

The ascetic Valmiki inquired Naarada - 'who engaged deeply in austerity and study of Vedas, best among the eloquent and
eminent among sages' (as follows:)

<Commentary>
  The epic starts with the word auspicious word ta as said in 'takaarovighnanaashakaH', 'takaarosaukhyadaayakaH'...
</Commentary>

"Who really is that person in this present world, who is virtuous and vigorous, a conscientious one, one who is mindful
of good deeds done to him, and also a speaker of truth and who is determined in his deed... [1-1-2] "Who is appropriate
in disposition... who is interested in welfare of all beings... who is adept and also an able one... also uniquely
pleasant to look at... [1-1-3]

<Commentary>
  The adeptness of that person is in his knowing all the knowable aspects in this world, and he must be able to retain
  that knowledge to translate into his deeds, not just to sit back with his bookish knowledge, but with utmost
  practicality. His conduct-wise character shall be acceptable i.e., by his lineage he shall be noble, by his education
  he must be well-read, by his actions they must be conducive to norms laid down in Veda-s, and thus given any area, he
  should conduct himself properly. And he must be benign not only to higher-ups but to lowly subjects, like Guha,
  Shabari et al., and he should deal with wrongdoers and right-doers conscientiously. Further, he in his mien he shall
  be pleasant, but not an unsightly one. The word eka also means 'unique' and thus his complexion, facial, physical
  structures etc., shall be unique and shall differ from ordinary beings. kShaNe kShaNe yat navataam upaiti tadeva
  ruupam ramaNiiyataayaaH 'which / what / who gets newness moment by moment, that alone is pleasant...'
</Commentary>

"Who is that self-composed one, who controlled his ire, who is brilliant, non-jealous and whom do even the gods fear,
when provoked to war... [1-1-4]

"All this I wish to listen from you, oh! Great Sage, you are competent to know this kind of man, and indeed my
inquisitiveness is immense..." Thus Valmiki enquired with Narada. [1-1-5]

<Commentary>
  Valmiki wanted to know about that man - a man with godly qualities. Valmiki is thinking aloud, about the qualities of
  his prospective hero of this epic and these are the very opening questions put to an Omniscient Sage Narada. Both the
  sages know of Rama and his deeds. Even then Valmiki asks Narada, "who is that man with godly qualities?' If Narada
  tells that Rama is Vishnu Himself, there is nothing left for Valmiki to compose his epic, because there are numerous
  mythologies, puraaNa-s, that have already adored God Vishnu. If Narada tells that Rama is so-and-so king, again
  Valmiki need not attempt to author about some king, however great that king might be.

<Commentary>
  The attributes of the hero of Ramayana, as required by Valmiki, are 16; sixteen in number.1 - guNavaan 2 - viryavaan 3
  - dharmaj~naH 4 - kR^itaj~naH 5 - satyavaakyaH 6 - dhR^iDhavrataH 7 - caaritravaan 8 - sarvabhuuteShu hitaH 9 -
  vidvaan 10 - samarthaH - 11 - priyadarshanaH 12 - aatmavaan 13 - jitakrodhaH 14 - dyutimaan 15 - anasuuyakaH 16 -
  bibhyatidevaaH These sixteen attributes are attributed to the sixteen phases of the Full Moon, and Valmiki is about to
  picture Rama to be as pleasant as a full-moon.
</Commentary>

On listening all those words of Valmiki, Narada, the knower of all the three worlds, said "let it be heard..." and
beckoning at Sage Valmiki to listen attentively, he spoke these words very gladly. [1-1-6]

Narada is cognizant of three worlds, where the three worlds are bhuuloka, bhuvarloka, suvarloka this world, the
intermediary heaven, the heavens themselve

"Oh! Sage Valmiki, the merits which you have extolled are many, and unattainable. I, after having known from Brahma of
such a man with all these merits, will speak on...Let it be heard." Thus Narada started to say. [1-1-7]

Narada came hither to impart the legend of Rama, as Brahma already imparted the same to him, and wanted him to impart
these very attributes to Valmiki to compose Ramayana. It is a coincidence of interests Valmiki and those of Narada and
Brahma.

"One emerged from Ikshvaku dynasty, known to people as Rama by name. He is with a controlled self, highly valorous,
resplendent, steadfast and a controller of (vice and vile... or) his own senses. [1-1-8]

<Commentary>
  For the attributes explained by Narada there are some Vedanta imports. From niyataatmaa to vashii these are the
  attributes of the Supreme Being, Absolute of Brahman. swaruupa-niruupaka- lakShaNaaH . This niyataatmaa is 'immutable
  Absolute, this is the postulate of any Upanishad: ya aatmaa apahatapaapmaa virajo vimR^ityurvishoko... 8-7-1,
  ChƒÅndogya-UpaniShad. mahaaviiryaH = acintya vividhavicitrashaktivaan Absolute is Omnicompetent paraa asya shaktiH
  vividhaa iva shruuyate svaabhaavikii j~naanabalakriyaa ca 6-8, Shwetaashvatara-UpaniShad. The word dyutimaan is for
  the attribute of Self-Resplendent Absolute, or, Resplendence of Consciousness. tam eva bhaantam anubhaati sarvam tasya
  bhaasaa sarvam idam bhaati 2-11, Mundaka-UpaniShad. And the dhR^ithimaan is Sublime Bliss, according to Vyjayanti
  dhR^itiH tu tuSTiH santoSaH and as said in aanando brahma - aanandaat eva khalu imaani bhuutaani jaayante 6,
  Taittariiya- Upanishad. Next, vashii Absolute is the Omnipotent on the entire Universe. eko vahii sarva
  bhuutaantaraatmaa 2-5-12, Katha-Upanishad and sarvasya vashii sarvasya iishaanaH and the like. The rest of the
  attributes of Rama as said by Narada are identifiable with the causative factors of that Absolute in Creation, and the
  process of Creation is the self-expression of the Absolute.
