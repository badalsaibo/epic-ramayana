# Introduction

Divine sage Narada arrives at the hermitage of Sage Valmiki in order to enlighten him and keep him informed of his duty
to author the epic poem Ramayana. In the dialogue between these two sages, Valmiki elicits from Narada about most
virtuous person on earth, namely Rama. In this opening chapter, while eulogizing Rama Narada gives an outline of
Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes in this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality,
chastity and the like. Valmiki Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of
Gayatri Hymn, and a thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of each letter. Though that
classification, or dividing verses into thousand chapters is unavailable now, the twenty-four verses identified with the
24 letters of Gayatri hymn, called as Gayatri Ramayana, is available and it is given in the endnote of this page. In
tune with the scheme of Gayatri, Ramayana starts the first verse with letter ta an auspicious letter.

The ascetic Valmiki inquired Naarada - 'who engaged deeply in austerity and study of Vedas, best among the eloquent and
eminent among sages' (as follows:) [1-1-1]

<Commentary>
  The epic starts with the word auspicious word ta as said in 'takaarovighnanaashakaH', 'takaarosaukhyadaayakaH'...
</Commentary>

"Who really is that person in this present world, who is virtuous and vigorous, a conscientious one, one who is mindful
of good deeds done to him, and also a speaker of truth and who is determined in his deed... [1-1-2]

"Who is appropriate in disposition... who is interested in welfare of all beings... who is adept and also an able one...
also uniquely pleasant to look at... [1-1-3]

<Commentary>
  The adeptness of that person is in his knowing all the knowable aspects in this world, and he must be able to retain
  that knowledge to translate into his deeds, not just to sit back with his bookish knowledge, but with utmost
  practicality. His conduct-wise character shall be acceptable i.e., by his lineage he shall be noble, by his education
  he must be well-read, by his actions they must be conducive to norms laid down in Veda-s, and thus given any area, he
  should conduct himself properly. And he must be benign not only to higher-ups but to lowly subjects, like Guha,
  Shabari et al., and he should deal with wrongdoers and right-doers conscientiously. Further, he in his mien he shall
  be pleasant, but not an unsightly one. The word eka also means 'unique' and thus his complexion, facial, physical
  structures etc., shall be unique and shall differ from ordinary beings. kShaNe kShaNe yat navataam upaiti tadeva
  ruupam ramaNiiyataayaaH 'which / what / who gets newness moment by moment, that alone is pleasant...'
</Commentary>

"Who is that self-composed one, who controlled his ire, who is brilliant, non-jealous and whom do even the gods fear,
when provoked to war... [1-1-4]

"All this I wish to listen from you, oh! Great Sage, you are competent to know this kind of man, and indeed my
inquisitiveness is immense..." Thus Valmiki enquired with Narada. [1-1-5]

<Commentary>
  Valmiki wanted to know about that man - a man with godly qualities. Valmiki is thinking aloud, about the qualities of
  his prospective hero of this epic and these are the very opening questions put to an Omniscient Sage Narada. Both the
  sages know of Rama and his deeds. Even then Valmiki asks Narada, "who is that man with godly qualities?' If Narada
  tells that Rama is Vishnu Himself, there is nothing left for Valmiki to compose his epic, because there are numerous
  mythologies, puraaNa-s, that have already adored God Vishnu. If Narada tells that Rama is so-and-so king, again
  Valmiki need not attempt to author about some king, however great that king might be.
</Commentary>

<Commentary>
  The attributes of the hero of Ramayana, as required by Valmiki, are 16; sixteen in number.1 - guNavaan 2 - viryavaan 3
  - dharmaj~naH 4 - kR^itaj~naH 5 - satyavaakyaH 6 - dhR^iDhavrataH 7 - caaritravaan 8 - sarvabhuuteShu hitaH 9 -
  vidvaan 10 - samarthaH - 11 - priyadarshanaH 12 - aatmavaan 13 - jitakrodhaH 14 - dyutimaan 15 - anasuuyakaH 16 -
  bibhyatidevaaH These sixteen attributes are attributed to the sixteen phases of the Full Moon, and Valmiki is about to
  picture Rama to be as pleasant as a full-moon.
</Commentary>

On listening all those words of Valmiki, Narada, the knower of all the three worlds, said "let it be heard..." and
beckoning at Sage Valmiki to listen attentively, he spoke these words very gladly. [1-1-6]

Narada is cognizant of three worlds, where the three worlds are bhuuloka, bhuvarloka, suvarloka this world, the
intermediary heaven, the heavens themselve

"Oh! Sage Valmiki, the merits which you have extolled are many, and unattainable. I, after having known from Brahma of
such a man with all these merits, will speak on...Let it be heard." Thus Narada started to say. [1-1-7]

Narada came hither to impart the legend of Rama, as Brahma already imparted the same to him, and wanted him to impart
these very attributes to Valmiki to compose Ramayana. It is a coincidence of interests Valmiki and those of Narada and
Brahma.

"One emerged from Ikshvaku dynasty, known to people as Rama by name. He is with a controlled self, highly valorous,
resplendent, steadfast and a controller of (vice and vile... or) his own senses. [1-1-8]

<Commentary>
  For the attributes explained by Narada there are some Vedanta imports. From niyataatmaa to vashii these are the
  attributes of the Supreme Being, Absolute of Brahman. swaruupa-niruupaka- lakShaNaaH . This niyataatmaa is 'immutable
  Absolute, this is the postulate of any Upanishad: ya aatmaa apahatapaapmaa virajo vimR^ityurvishoko... 8-7-1,
  Chāndogya-UpaniShad. mahaaviiryaH = acintya vividhavicitrashaktivaan Absolute is Omnicompetent paraa asya shaktiH
  vividhaa iva shruuyate svaabhaavikii j~naanabalakriyaa ca 6-8, Shwetaashvatara-UpaniShad. The word dyutimaan is for
  the attribute of Self-Resplendent Absolute, or, Resplendence of Consciousness. tam eva bhaantam anubhaati sarvam tasya
  bhaasaa sarvam idam bhaati 2-11, Mundaka-UpaniShad. And the dhR^ithimaan is Sublime Bliss, according to Vyjayanti
  dhR^itiH tu tuSTiH santoSaH and as said in aanando brahma - aanandaat eva khalu imaani bhuutaani jaayante 6,
  Taittariiya- Upanishad. Next, vashii Absolute is the Omnipotent on the entire Universe. eko vahii sarva
  bhuutaantaraatmaa 2-5-12, Katha-Upanishad and sarvasya vashii sarvasya iishaanaH and the like. The rest of the
  attributes of Rama as said by Narada are identifiable with the causative factors of that Absolute in Creation, and the
  process of Creation is the self-expression of the Absolute.
</Commentary>

"He is a wise one, moralist, eloquent, glorious, and a destroyer of enemies. His arms are lengthy, with three lines in
the neck [indicative of good fortune], and cheekbones high... [1-1-9]

<Commentary>
  The Absolute is an adept one in creating the Creation yat sarvaj~naH sarvavit. He is niitimaan one who maintains the
  rhythm of universe as said at eSa setuH vidharaNa eSaam lokanaamasambhedaaya... He is propitious because shriiH
  kaantisaMpadoH lakshmyaam... gleaming, glistering richness of prosperity emanates from him. The following stanzas
  describe the physical qualities an Emperor should have by birth, as per saamudrikashaastra, the physiognomic treatise
  of astrology.
</Commentary>

"He is lion-chested, with concealed collarbones, knee-length are his arms, and his is a long bow, an enemy-subjugator,
and his emperor's countenance is with a crowning-head and an ample forehead, and his gait is majestic like that of a
lion... [1-1-10]

<Commentary>
  When his physique is extolled, suddenly a weapon is said, in saying that 'his is longbow...' this is called
  prakramabhangadoSa 'jump-cut in narration...' It is not so, his lengthy arms are said firstly and those arms can wield
  a great bow that can eliminate enemies, both physical and psychological ones like ariSaDvarga like desire, ire,
  avarice, conceit etc., as detailed in verse 4 above.
</Commentary>

"He is built proportionately physically, with limbs poised symmetrically, sinew-chested, wide-eyed, complexioned
charmingly... he is a prosperous one with all the auspicious features ... [1-1-11]

<Commentary>
  Up to here the godly physical aspect bhagavadvigraha is explained that which is perceptible by the adherents as said
  in Chāndogya Upanishad: ya eSo antaraaditye hiraNmayaH puruSo dR^ishyate... 1-6-6. From now on, the features that are
  reliable for the adherers are said.
</Commentary>

"He is the knower of rectitude, bidden by the truth, also his concern is in the welfare of subjects, proficient in
prudence, clean in his conduct, self-controlled and an attentive one... [1-1-12]

"He equals Lord Vishnu, the Lord of all creatures, Sustainer of the Universe, together with Sri Lakshmi (shriimaan =
lakShmiivaan), Eliminator of enemies, Protector of the world of living creatures and complete Guardian of probity...
[1-1-13]

<Commentary>
  The word रक्षिता is the Nominative Singular of रक्षितृ and means Protector. Please note that prajaapatiH can be
  applied to Vedic Gods as well as to Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Maheswara. Here we consider Rama as equalling
  the Supreme God Lord Vishnu who is the One with Goddess Sri Lakshmi and also the sustainer. prajaapatiH is thus being
  translated as Lord Vishnu. Please note that we are deviating from traditional translations of prajaapatiH as Lord
  Brahma here and this is intentional. 'These features show the aspects of Rama's incarnation...' Govindaraja. 'These
  features are available only in the Supreme Person, but unobtainable in any other...' Maheshvara Tiirtha. These two,
  Govindaraja and Maheshvara Tiirtha are reputed commentators on Ramayana among many others.
</Commentary>

"He is the preserver of his own righteousness and also a champion for adherent's welfare in the same righteousness, and
he is a scholar in the essence of Veda-s and their ancillaries, too. He is an expert in dhanurVeda, the Art of
Archery... [1-1-14]

<Commentary>
  These are the ancillary subjects of Vedas called anga part and upa-anga sub-part. The main parts of Veda-s are
  shikShaa ritual rigor vyaakaraNa grammar chandas prosody jyotishya astrology nirukta recital rules kalpa procedure
  rules. This apart, the dhanurveda science of archery, itself is treated as 'an exclusive Veda taught to warriors...'
  The dhanurveda is not to be construed as simple bow and arrow and 'shooting the target' education. It is a 'scripture
  on missiles' that existed in those ages.
</Commentary>

<Commentary>
  Down the memory lane, O. A.Vijayan, the eminent Indian journalist has reflected in The Illustrated Weekly of India,
  that the Soviet scholar Dr. A. A. Gorbovsky said in his article with heading Ancient India may have had N-arms , in
  the Statesman, with dateline Moscow, Sept. 8, 1986. Among other things, the scientist observes by the stanzas that
  describe the disaster caused by such astra-s, now loosely termed as a well crafted bow and sky rocketing arrows, as
  below:
</Commentary>

<Commentary>
  'A blazing shaft which possessed all the effulgence of smokeless fire was let off... all directions were enveloped by
  darkness... the very elements seemed to be perturbed... the sun seemed to turn... the universe, scorched with heat,
  seemed to be in fever... the survivors lost their hair and nails... for years the sun and sky remained shrouded with
  clouds...'
</Commentary>

<Commentary>
  Thus the narration goes on. This is the account of Brahmaastra, as in Mahabharata, the other Epic of India. Thus the
  Dhanurveda may be taken as the canon of missile sciences, which fortunately has not been handed over to the successive
  generations, lest everything would have been annihilated by now. In Ramayana too, which is much earlier to
  Mahabharata, there are elaborate accounts of such astra-s in the coming chapters. Sage Vishvamitra, who is well-versed
  in warfare, gives many such weapons to Rama. For now, these bow and arrow references may not be taken as those of
  Robin Hood.
</Commentary>

"He is the knower of the meaning and essence of all the scriptures, excellent at memory, a brilliant one, and dear to
all the worlds, gentle, level-headed and clear-headed in discriminating and distinguishing... [1-1-15]

"Like an ocean that is reached by rivers, that reverential one too is always accessible and reachable by clean-minded
ones, and he treats all equally, and ever a feast to eye... [1-1-16]

<Commentary>
  Here it is said 'he is reachable by all clean-minded ones...' satpravartana, sadbudhhi... and those that approach him
  with a sacrilegious intent, will meet their end at his hand. sarvasamaH means, that he does not discriminate people by
  their caste, creed, or by that individual's philosophy etc., like tribal boatman Guha, low-birthed Shabari, and
  nihilist Sage Jaabaali et al. jaati-guNa- vR^itti-aadi bhedaabhaavaat And the word eva in sa eva priyadarshanaH
  indicates 'always...' 'unvarying in his demeanour with anyone...' Govindaraja. And by the simile of ocean to Rama, for
  rivers there is no other course except an ocean; thus, the living beings, may it be humans or birds like Jataayu, have
  no other recourse than Rama.
